# Introduction

AFK Privacy is an opinion market with ZK using Noir, built on the Noir Hack.


# Description

Anon all-in-one platform using zkDID for Identity stuff.

Starting with Social and governance usecases:
- Organizations.
- Country
- Age 

# Acknowledgements

We build from a Fork of StealthNote for privacy social network:

Thank you for the amazing work on Public good and Privacy!

## Why?

- Ask something as anon in a community (company, country, more soon)
- Target users from organizations or identity to vote anonymously.

# Tech and tools used

- ZK Email
- ZK JWT
- ZK Kit
- Zk Passport SDK
- Garaga (WIP for Onchain poll/DAO)

# Done

We fork StealthNote for the ZK-JWT with Google Workspace for Organization community.

Now you can also create post and poll for everyone or internal private community chat.

You can enter a chat from a company or country.
We plan to add also the community adult/young and others fun things can come (interest, hobbies like Reddit).

Features:

Messages and Poll for Public or Internal community like Organizations and Company.

- Post something visible for everyone as a members of community like company or country (soon Anon individual)
- Reply to post as an anon

- Integrate ZK-Passport for Identity verification
- Integrate Self.xyz for ZK Identity verification
- Express yourself anonymously and send something internally to your community verified (company or country).

- Creation of a poll with requirements (everyone, organizations, countries)
- Public poll but only people from org/country can vote.
- Internal poll only visible by the member of the community
- Vote to a poll and check the requirements to vote

# After NoirHack

We want to continue this project after the NoirHack to build an anon opinion market and social network. 

## Ideas for the next milestone:

- Proof of Humanity for our Social network on Nostr, also Farcaster, Lens and more.
- Poll app with onchain vote.
- Anon governance with DAO
- Rewards to vote for a poll/form
- Futarchy DAO
- Add survey/form

## Enhance

- Refactoring + Improve DB models (country with messages) 
- Sanitize and security check +Secure communication and middleware
- Data encryption + Security check
